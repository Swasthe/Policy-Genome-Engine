## ⭐ How to Use the Features

### 🔹 Policy Analysis
Paste any policy description into the text box and click **Analyze Policy**.

The system will:

✅ Compare the policy with existing national policies  
✅ Identify the most similar policies  
✅ Calculate similarity scores  
✅ Predict transferability  
✅ Detect potential implementation risks  
✅ Generate explainable AI insights  


### 🔹 Transferability Score
Indicates the likelihood that the proposed policy can succeed based on historical similarity.

- 🟢 High → Strong alignment with proven policies  
- 🟡 Moderate → Partial alignment  
- 🔴 Low → Higher implementation uncertainty  


### 🔹 Risk Indicator
Highlights potential challenges in adopting the policy.


### 🔹 Policy Strength Score
Provides a numerical estimate of policy effectiveness.


### 🔹 Explainable AI Insight
Explains WHY the recommendation was made, improving transparency in decision-making.
